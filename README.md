# PSI
Python implementation of Phase Sorting Interferometry (PSI) for estimating non-common path errors in High Contrast Imaging (HCI) instruments.

This PSI package is developed primarily for ELT/METIS, but also for VLT/ERIS.


## Legacy contribution
This work is based on the initial work of Emiel Por, followed-up by the work of Matthew Willson†:
- [fepsi](https://github.com/mkenworthy/fepsi) : written by Emiel Por and modified by Matthew Kenworthy (Leiden University)
- [psi](https://github.com/mwillson-astro/PSI/tree/master) : preliminary package developed by Matthew Willson† for METIS (Liège University)

The initial commit of this repository is a copy of [psi](https://github.com/mwillson-astro/PSI/tree/master).

## Dependencies

Code requires the following Python package : `hcipy` and all its dependencies.

The ffmpeg tools are required for generating movies.

[HCIPy](https://github.com/ehpor/hcipy) is a Python software package written and developed by Emiel Por for performing end-to-end simulations of high contrast imaging instruments for astronomy.

We recommand to use the latest release: 0.5.0 on 18 August 2022
(minimum required: '0.4.1.dev137+gc1ea9e5' - master version of 5 December 2021).
